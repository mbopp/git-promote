===========

Shell Script to help facilitate promoting from one environment (branch) to another

There are number of scripts out there that help developers deal with streamlining the version control process. This is one of them.  With a single command you can checkout a <target> branch and merge your development (or test) branch eventually committing and pushing the changes on the <target> branch.
